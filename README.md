# Quantified Self Project for CPSC 222, Spring 2025 
### Author: Devyn Hubbs

About this project:  
**Title:** My Sophomore Strava
**Description:** This project is a piece included in the CPSC 222 course at Gonzaga University. The purpose of the project is to explore and analyze personally collected longitudinal data.  The focus of this project is on data collected from a personal **Strava** account, which is an fitness recording app. The data includes over 100 fitness activities recorded in the past school year. The inspiration behind using this data is I joined the Gonzaga Women's Rowing Team my freshman year of college, and I just started seriously recording my workouts using **Strava** this year. Seeing as I had never rowed before, the improvement curve was expected to very intense at first. I wanted to see if I could find proof of the *novice* curve, find fitness patterns of this new sport, and compare rowing with other workouts I have done for years.  
**How to Access:** To run this project, open `StravaEDA.ipynb` and simply run the entire file. All important, immediate information will be displayed and explained in this file. To access the back end code, open `utils.py`. This includes all functions used in this project. 
**Important Information:** This project was written within the requirements of the **DA8 Quantified Self Project** for the CPSC 222 course at Gonzaga University. All code written is original to this course.
